2. Replace `assets/splash-icon.png` with your splash screen icon
3. Replace `assets/adaptive-icon.png` for Android adaptive icon (foreground)
4. Replace `assets/favicon.png` for web favicon

## Adding Custom Icons

Place custom icons and images in this directory and import them in your components:

```typescript
import fireIcon from '../assets/fire-icon.png';
```
